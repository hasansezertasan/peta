=======
When a ``peta`` console root exists (``include_console_root`` —
the CLI, or ≥2 components sharing a launcher; see ADR-019), ``main()`` runs it,
which dispatches to the primary component by default and to each secondary via a
subcommand. Otherwise the single enabled component with the highest precedence —
CLI > GUI > TUI > web > MCP > worker — is wired to ``main()`` directly at
template-generation time (via the Jinja conditionals below). To change the
default entrypoint, re-render with a different component enabled or edit the
import/``main`` binding here directly. With no runnable component enabled,
``main()`` exits non-zero with an explanatory message.
